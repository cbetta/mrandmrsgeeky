      <p class='info-text'>
        We have been together for 12 years so we're not your usual newlywed couple.
        As we already have a lot things that most newlyweds need (and because we don't want to carry heavy things back to London) we'd prefer to receive money instead of gifts to make the following items (and more) possible.
        Some is for our home, some is for our honeymoon this year, and some is for our holiday in Italy this summer.
      </p>

      <p class='info-footer text-right'>
        Melinda &amp; Cristiano
      </p>

      <p class='info-payment'>
        PS: We're happy to accept your gifts at the reception in person, via PayPal on <strong>paypal@mrandmrsgeeky.com</strong> or in any other way if you might be inclined to give us a bag of pennies.
      </p>
