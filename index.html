        We have been together for 12 years so we're not your usual newlyweds.
        We already have a lot things most newlyweds need so for our wishlist we'd prefer to get money instead of gifts to make the following (and more) possible.
        Some is for our home, some is for our honeymoon this year, and some is for our holiday in Italy this summer.
